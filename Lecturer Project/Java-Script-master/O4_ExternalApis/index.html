<h1>Single Thread Management in Browsers</h1>
<p>In Browsers we are not allowed to access more than one thread. So if we wanted to
run multiple process at the same time we have to use External APIS</p>
<h2>What are these external APIS.? Let's talk about it in future</h2>
<br>

<h1>But here we have inbuilt functionality which we can use for time waiting</h1>
<p>They are integrated with the core library</p>
<h1>Timers in JS</h1>
<p>We have two timers</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set TimeOut</li>
    <li>Set Interval</li>
</ul>

<script>
    //In JS we don't have access to the threads
    // We are only allowed to access one thread
    // But if we wanted to wait something before calling or
    //if we want to invoke a method repetitively then we have to use a
    //external api for that
    //So we have timers for that. timers are external apis which was
    //integrated to the browser for time-consuming processes

    //we have two timers
    //setTimeout -> runs only ones after completing the time
    var sid=setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("Hello there how are you.?")
    }, 20000);

    clearTimeout(sid);// we can stop setTimeout at any point by calling this method
    //and passing the timerID


    //set interval -> runs repetitively after completing a one round of waiting time
    let c = 0;
   var id= setInterval(function () {
        c++;
        console.log(c);
    }, 1000);

   clearInterval(id);// stop the set Interval
